---Complete Summary: Merging Two Sorted Linked Lists---

The Problem:
Combine two already-sorted linked lists into one sorted list by rearranging the existing nodes (not creating new ones).

Key Concepts We Learned
1. Linked List Basics

A linked list is like a treasure hunt - each node points to the next one
Each node has two parts:

.val - the value stored (the number)
.next - pointer to the next node (or None if it's the last)

2. The __init__ Method

A special setup function that runs automatically when creating objects
Like a factory's assembly instructions
self means "this specific object I'm creating right now"

pythonclass ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val    # Store the value
        self.next = next  # Store the pointer

3. Creating and Connecting Nodes
pythonnode1 = ListNode(1)  # Create a node with value 1
node2 = ListNode(2)  # Create a node with value 2
node1.next = node2   # Link them together

The Algorithm Strategy
The Core Idea
Since both lists are already sorted, we can:

Compare the front nodes of both lists
Pick whichever is smaller
Add it to our merged list
Move forward in that list
Repeat until one list is empty
Attach whatever remains (it's guaranteed to be bigger)

The "Dummy Node" Trick

Create a fake placeholder node to make building easier
dummy stays at the start (our anchor)
current moves along as we build (our worker)
At the end, return dummy.next to skip the placeholder


The Complete Solution:

pythondef mergeTwoLists(list1, list2):
    # Step 1: Create dummy node as starting point
    dummy = ListNode()
    current = dummy  # Worker pointer starts at dummy

    # Step 2: While both lists have nodes, compare and merge
    while list1 and list2:
        if list1.val < list2.val:  # Compare VALUES not nodes
            current.next = list1    # Connect smaller node
            list1 = list1.next      # Move forward in list1
        else:
            current.next = list2    # Connect smaller node
            list2 = list2.next      # Move forward in list2

        current = current.next      # Move worker forward

    # Step 3: Attach leftover nodes (whichever list isn't empty)
    current.next = list1 or list2

    # Step 4: Return actual list (skip the dummy)
    return dummy.next
    (if we just returned "dummy" we would have an extra node)

Important Takeaways
✅ Use .val and .next (no parentheses - they're attributes, not methods)
✅ Compare values, not nodes: list1.val < list2.val
✅ Move pointers forward: list1 = list1.next
✅ Dummy node pattern makes building linked lists much easier
✅ Leverage the sorted property - leftovers can just be attached at the end
